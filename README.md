# Hello Android
This project consists of experiment in compiling Android apps, (command line only) from several languages. The main goal is to compare the Java and Kotlin implementations to be able to develop a tool allowing to use the OCaml programming language to write Android apps, using the [Ocaml-Java](http://ocamljava.org/) tool.

We'll start with a simple Hello-World app (of course), and then add more (and for that, we'll need to add the relevant part of the runtime to the OCaml library).
